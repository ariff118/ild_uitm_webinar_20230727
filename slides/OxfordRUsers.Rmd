- a header between three dashes
- we have these key-value pairs, like 'title: "Diamond sizes"'
- with these we specify meta-data about the document, such as title, author date, etc. and information about what kind of output format we want

# Code chunks

![](figures/chunk-parts.png)

**Some common chunk options** (see e.g. [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html))
- `echo`: whether or not to display code in knitted output
- `eval`: whether or to to run the code in the chunk when knitting
- `fig.cap`: figure caption

---

# Typical chunks
### Setup chunk
````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
# don't show code unless we explicitly set echo = TRUE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
```
````

--
- Normally, an R Markdown document starts with a chunk that's used to set some options and load required libraries.

--
- `knitr::opts_chunk$set` sets default options for all chunks.

<br>

--
- Gotcha: when using [`kable`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.21/topics/kable), captions  are set inside the `kable` function
- The `kable` package is often used with the [`kableExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) package
- A number of other packages are available for making pretty tables, see [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html)

---
class: larger-body
# Inline code

--
Inside your text you can include code with the syntax <span>&#96;</span>r code here&#96;.


--
For example, <span>&#96;</span>r 4 + 4&#96; would output `r 4 + 4` in your text.

--
```{r, echo = TRUE}
print(diamonds, n = 5)

num_diamonds <- nrow(diamonds)

```

- The `bookdown` package adds cross-referencing. <br> Normally you'll use to refer to **figures**, **tables**, and **sections** within your document.

--
- To enable this, set output to e.g. `bookdown::html_document2`, `bookdown::pdf_document2`, `bookdown::word_document2`, in the YAML header (see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/output-formats.html))


--
```yaml
---
title: "Cross-referencing test"
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```

--
- The basic cross-reference syntax is `\@ref(label)` 

--
- figures: `\@ref(fig:label)`, tables: `\@ref(tab:label)`

---
class: larger-body
## Figure references

.pull-left[
````markdown
`r ''````{r captain, fig.cap="A marvel-lous meme"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/captain.jpeg")
```
````

```{r captain, fig.align='center', fig.cap="A marvel-lous meme", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/captain.jpeg")
```

]


--
.pull-right[
- Refer to this image with `\@ref(fig:captain)`
]


---
class: larger-body
## Figure and table references
.pull-left[
````markdown
`r ''````{r cars}
knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],
            caption="Stopping cars")
```
````

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],
            caption="Stopping cars")
```

]


--
.pull-right[
- Refer to this table with `\@ref(tab:cars)`
]

---
class: larger-body
### Section references
- Assing a label to a header by adding `{#label}` after it, e.g. `# My awesome header {#test-label}`.


--
- Then reference `# My awesome header` with `\@ref(test-label)`


--
- .Rmd: `See section \@ref(test-label)` -> output: 'See section 1'

## Appearance and style
- In HTML output, you can use `theme` or a custom **.css** style sheet

--
- `theme` options (see them at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/)) : *“cerulean”, “journal”, “flatly”, “darkly”, “readable”, “spacelab”, “united”, “cosmo”, “lumen”, “paper”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “yeti”*


--
.pull-left[
For example:
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: darkly
---
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="75%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_theme.png")
```

]

---
class: larger-body
## Appearance and style
- For fine-grained control, supply a specific template to use for the output document:

```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    template: my_template.html

  bookdown::pdf_document2:
*    template: my_template.tex

  bookdown::word_document2:
*    reference_docx: my-styles.docx #note: 'reference_docx'

## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown

--
- The [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package contains a range of ready-made templates for paper submissions

--
- At the moment, many of the templates are not well documented, and it can be difficult to understand what's going on under the hood

--
- It's useful to know a bit about how it works, if you need to submit a paper formatted with LaTeX but want to write in R Markdown

--
- Let's have a look at the [PLOS LaTeX template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/public-library-of-science-plos)


---
## What's a LaTeX template anyway?

.pull-left[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/plos_latex.png")
```

]


--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_compiled.png")
```
]

## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown

  bookdown::pdf_document2:

.pull-right[

## plos_latex_template.tex
- Dollar signs have special meaning for `pandoc`


--
- in the template document, `pandoc` will look for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and insert the corresponding content in your **.Rmd** file, before the output document is created


--
- `$` is escaped with another `$`


--
.pull-left[
If we take a look at line 57 in **plos_latex_template.tex** we see this:
```latex
% For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $x^2$ 
(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


--
.pull-right[
- We change to this:<br>
<br>

```latex
% For example, x$$^2$$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $$x^2$$ 
(or $$\mathrm{x}^2$$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]

---
class: larger-body

## plos_latex_template.tex
- Fix this throughout and we get normal compilation of the LaTeX template to PDF:


--
.pull-left[

```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template_adapted.tex
---
```

```{r, out.width="88%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("figures/template_escapes.png")
```


]


--
.pull-right[

```{r, out.width = "95%"}
include_graphics("figures/template_compiled.png")
```
]

---
class: larger-body

## Plug in information from our **.Rmd** file
- Find the places in the LaTeX template where you want to insert content from your R Markdown document

--
- Wrap variables from your YAML header in `$`'s to insert them, e.g. `\textbf\newline{$title$}` 

--
- To insert all the content after your YAML header, type `$body$`


--
.pull-left[
```latex
\textbf\newline{Title of submission to PLOS journals}
\\
Name1 Surname\textsuperscript{1,2\Yinyang},
Name2 Surname\textsuperscript{2\Yinyang},
Name3 Surname\textsuperscript{2,3\textcurrency},

# Introduction

"Tribute" is the first single of Tenacious D's self-titled debut album. 
It was released July 16, 2002.
The song is a tribute to what Gass and Black refer to as "The Greatest Song in the World" (often confused as the song's title), which Tenacious D themselves came up with, but have since forgotten. 
It was released as a downloadable track for Rock Band in addition to appearing as a playable track for Guitar Hero Live.

# 3 steps in adapting a LaTeX template

1. Make it compile correctly with just the template content (watch out for `$` signs)

2. Pull in the content you want from the YAML header and the body, by surrounding the relevant stuff in dollar signs

3. Enable code inclusion, by adding this at the top for **.tex** template

```latex
$if(highlighting-macros)$
$highlighting-macros$
$endif$
```
